# Dei8 AI - Your Professional Writing & Publishing Studio

## 🚀 Introduction

Dei8 AI is an intelligent studio designed to be a professional partner for literary authors. It transforms the solitary process of writing into an interactive, AI-assisted journey, from initial analysis and drafting to critique and automated publishing.

The latest release introduces a secure backend proxy around the Google Docs API. Instead of asking Gemini to follow a link blindly, the application now authenticates with Google, ingests the real document, converts it into a structured outline, and stores a normalized "Work Profile" for downstream tooling. The React workspace automatically spins up drafting, critique, and polishing pages while the chat assistant leverages the actual manuscript text for contextual responses.

## ✨ Core Features

* **✍️ Professional Editorial Assistant:** Engage with an AI trained to act as a professional editor, providing insightful feedback on drafts.
* **🔗 Google Doc Integration via API:** Paste a Google Docs URL into the new upload form. The backend proxies the request, handles OAuth or Service Accounts, and returns a structured JSON model of your story.
* **📖 Automated Work Profile:** Every ingestion converts headings and paragraphs into a persistent profile summarizing plot beats, style, writing habits, and word counts.
* **⚡️ Efficient Updates:** Re-ingesting the same document refreshes the stored profile and workspace without duplicating pages.
* **🎨 Dynamic Workspace Canvas:** The infinite canvas still provides dedicated Draft, Critique, and Final pages for each story with pan/zoom controls.
* **🤖 Automated Publishing:** Ask the assistant to publish and it prepares the payload for the target platform (simulation ready).
* **💾 Persistent State:** Messages, work profiles, and canvas pages are stored in `localStorage` so your studio survives refreshes.

## 🧠 How the Pipeline Works

1. **UploadDocForm (frontend):** The React sidebar renders `UploadDocForm.tsx`, which calls `POST /api/google-docs/ingest` with the user-provided URL. It surfaces loading states and explicit permission errors from Google.
2. **Express Backend Proxy:** `server/index.ts` exposes `/api/google-docs` routes. Requests flow through `services/googleDocsService.ts`, which authenticates with Google using OAuth refresh tokens or Service Accounts.
3. **Google Docs Service:** `googleDocsService` downloads the document, walks through paragraphs/headings, and produces a normalized `StructuredGoogleDoc` JSON payload.
4. **Conversion & Storage:** `convertGoogleDocToWorkProfile` extracts key analytics (outline, writing style heuristics, author habits) and saves them in the in-memory store (`server/storage/workProfilesStore.ts`).
5. **Frontend Hydration:** The response hydrates a `WorkProfile` in React, spawns Draft/Critique/Final canvas pages, and posts an assistant summary message.
6. **Context-Aware Chat:** `services/geminiService.ts` now injects document outlines and truncated manuscript text when sending prompts to Gemini, ensuring critiques reference the real story instead of a bare URL.

## 💻 Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind-style utility classes.
* **Backend:** Express 4 (TypeScript), Google APIs Node client, CORS middleware.
* **AI Model:** Google Gemini API (`@google/genai`).
* **Document Ingestion:** Google Docs API via OAuth 2.0 or Service Accounts.
* **State Persistence:** Browser `localStorage` for client-side data; in-memory store for the API proxy.

## 🧰 Environment Configuration

| Variable | Where | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `API_KEY` | Frontend & backend | Gemini API key consumed by `@google/genai`.
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | Backend | OAuth 2.0 client ID (installed application or web application).
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Backend | OAuth 2.0 client secret.
| `GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN` | Backend | Long-lived refresh token obtained after user consent. Required for OAuth mode.
| `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI` | Backend | Redirect URI used when minting the refresh token. Optional for service accounts.
| `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL` | Backend | Service account email (alternative auth path).
| `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY` | Backend | Service account private key. Remember to replace literal `\n` with real newlines.
| `PORT` | Backend | Port for the Express server (default `3001`).
| `CORS_ORIGIN` | Backend | Comma-separated list of allowed origins for CORS (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).
| `VITE_API_BASE_URL` | Frontend | Base URL for API calls (e.g., `http://localhost:3001`). Leave blank when serving from the same origin.

> **Authentication Options:** Provide either the OAuth fields (`GOOGLE_CLIENT_*` + `GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN`) or the service account fields. If both are present, the service account takes precedence.

## 🔑 Setting Up Google Cloud Credentials

1. **Create or select a Google Cloud project.**
2. **Enable the Google Docs API:** In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to *APIs & Services → Library* and enable *Google Docs API*.
3. **Choose your authentication model:**
   * **Service Account (server-to-server):**
     1. Create a new service account under *APIs & Services → Credentials*.
     2. Generate a JSON key and copy `client_email` and `private_key` into the `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL` and `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY` variables (convert `\n` to actual newlines).
     3. Share every document you plan to ingest with the service account email (view access is sufficient).
   * **OAuth Client (user consent):**
     1. Create an OAuth 2.0 Client ID. For local development you can use an "Desktop" or "Web" application type.
     2. Add `http://localhost:3001/oauth2callback` (or your chosen redirect) to the authorized redirect URIs.
     3. Use the client ID/secret to run a one-time OAuth flow (for example with [Google's OAuth playground](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground)). Request the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.readonly` scope, authorize, and copy the refresh token into `GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN`.
4. **Store credentials securely:** Use `.env` files or your deployment's secret manager. Never commit raw credentials to version control.

## ▶️ Running the Project Locally

1. **Install dependencies** (requires access to npm registry packages referenced in `package.json`):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   > If your environment blocks certain packages, ensure whitelisting for `googleapis`, `express`, and related `@types` packages.
2. **Create environment files:**
   * Backend (`.env` or shell exports): set Google credentials, `API_KEY`, `PORT`, and `CORS_ORIGIN`.
   * Frontend (`.env.local`): set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to `http://localhost:3001` (or empty if proxied) and `API_KEY`.
3. **Start the backend proxy:**
   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```
4. **Start the Vite dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
5. **Use the studio:** Open the frontend (default `http://localhost:5173`), paste a Google Docs URL into the "Phân tích Google Docs" form, and monitor status messages for loading or permission issues.

## 🧭 Usage Tips

* The assistant posts a summary message automatically after ingestion. Re-uploading the same document replaces the existing workspace instead of duplicating it.
* Chat prompts now include the manuscript outline and truncated text, enabling far more specific critiques. Gemini responses will still emit `ACTION_CRITIQUE_DRAFT` blocks when applicable.
* Permission errors from Google (HTTP 401/403) appear directly in the sidebar form so you can fix sharing or refresh tokens quickly.
